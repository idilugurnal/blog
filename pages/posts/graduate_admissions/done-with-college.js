      post="Deciding what to do after graduation is without question, students’ biggest challenge. Some decide to work immediately, some pursue graduate studies and some, with money to spend, choose to travel. I, as a person with somewhat limited funds, decided to pursue graduate studies instead of traveling.

There are multiple reasons behind my decision to postpone a full time employment and instead spend some more time studying. Is it because I enjoy studying? Maybe, but it is not my motivation. The reasons behind my motivation are: the need of benefiting from the social life of a student, the urge of enhancing my knowledge in the career domain I chose and finally the dream of being employed outside of my country (preferably a job close to France would be suitable). Now the last one seems odd, but if you keep reading you will see the connection. Normally, it would be better if I introduced myself to you at the beginning of this article, but let me do it now since it just became relevant.

I am Idil a 23 year-old senior student studying Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. For those who don’t know this school, it is in Istanbul, Turkey and among the top tier schools in engineering. I will hopefully graduate by June 2020, if the Corona virus permits me to do so, and have the dilemma of getting into business or continuing graduate studies instead, since the beginning of 2019. Currently I am working at Accenture Istanbul as a part-time software developer and so far it is great. I am also enjoying doing my graduation project in Computer Vision domain. I would like to say I had a foreign experience in South Korea during my bachelor’s and would like to have a similar experience again. Let me continue with the reason and motivation behind me running after professors to ask for recommendation or taking the boring GRE and IELTS exams…

To explain the first reason behind my choice of continuing master’s, I enjoy being a student. I admit that continuous and tiring projects, challenging exams are not what makes me happy; but the environment around me is not something I am ready to give up yet. University is the climax of one’s social life, at least this is how I feel. The friendships I had during this time, the parties, projects… It is just the best time of my life. I am ready to face the challenges it brings if I will get the social part. In addition to this, I want this experience in a foreign country because I enjoyed the one I had in South Korea and it was definitely not enough. As a result, I had a strong motivation to not give up school yet.

As for my second reason, computer science for me is a complicated field. I had a really hard time getting familiar with theories, concepts and algorithms taught through my degree. I had to spend long hours on studying and improving my knowledge continuously. I believe a master’s degree is a great way to prep me for a better career. Not just the courses I will get, but the free time I will have as a student to further my skills will definitely be beneficial. And there goes my second grand motivation.

Finally, a job in Europe! “Why not the United States or South Korea since you liked it so much?” asks almost everyone I talk to. It is annoying to answer every time, but let me do it once again. Because simply I don’t want to. I spent a year in Korea during my studies at Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and I really enjoyed my time there. It was great! However, it was very far from home and for a long-term choice, I would not recommend. At least for people like me that have strong bonds with family and friends. Europe is fairly close to my hometown and it has great potential for higher education in Computer Science related fields. It is also far more affordable than the United States. And a bonus: my boyfriend lives there. Who am I kidding, it is not just a bonus…

So, there you go! Three simple reasons behind why I want to have a master’s degree in Europe. I just realized I missed one. One of my many dreams is to become a professor of Computer Science one day. Professors these days aren’t without a PhD let aside MSc. Also, one of my dreams is to become a leading manager in a well-known company. A leading woman in the business world. I guess I am not ready to choose one of them yet; I really need this master’s degree!!!

In the following articles I will explain what I did during my undergraduate studies to prep for my applications and the process of my admissions. I applied to more than 15 programs and got many offers in return (I was honestly not expecting that many!). If you have similar goals to mine, come and read my other posts.

Note: I did not apply to top tier schools like MIT, Princeton etc. (My GPA is around 3.3-3.4) so this blog will not be the ultimate guide to best schools in the world but it is for more humble students with less ambitious goals😜 (of course everyone is welcome to follow the advice ☺️)"
